# Overview

The [Decentralization Research Center (DRC)](thedrcenter.org) is excited to submit the research proposal below. We are a nonprofit organization that supports nonpartisan decentralization research and acts as a hub for critical stakeholders. Our mission is to encourage the equitable ownership, governance, and regulation of emerging technologies that impact our everyday lives.

In our proposed research, we aim to investigate how decentralization, especially as enabled by blockchain technology, can impact competition and offer solutions to monopolistic tendencies in various sectors. Central to this investigation is the potential that tools and protocols developed through MEV research and development have in fostering competitive environments in which privileged actors currently maintain dominant positions, and related implications for future antitrust policies and regulations. The study is inspired by some of our previous research, the paper we co-authored for the Harvard Kennedy School on equitable ownership and governance, and discussions with MEV builders

The hypothesis suggests that decentralized structures and technologies, including those underpinned by blockchain, can disrupt traditional power concentrations and foster a more equitable distribution of ownership and governance. The methodology involves a three-phase research process over six months. The first two months will focus on literature review and case study selection, including data collection through interviews and market research. The subsequent two months will be dedicated to writing and peer-reviewing the research paper. In the final phase, the team will draft shorter, accessible research outputs like blog posts and tweet threads, culminating in a presentation at the next DRC summit, which will likely be in DC in June 2024. Given that FRPs are typically completely within two months, this proposal is for work completed in the first phase of the project. 

The goal is to contribute meaningfully to the discourse on decentralization and its role in promoting competitive, equitable markets, and to ensure that message is ultimately communicated to decision makers who can impact the future of this technology.

## Background and Problem Statement

Motivated by the DRC’s mission to promote equitable ownership, governance, and regulation of emerging technologies, this proposal addresses the critical intersection of decentralization and antitrust regulation. Decentralization, a concept rooted in distributing power, ownership, and function away from central points, offers a new paradigm in organizational and technological structures. In the context of rising concerns over the concentration of power in the hands of a few dominant players, particularly in the technology sector, this research seeks to answer:

- How does decentralization impact competition in various sectors?
- Can decentralized structures and technologies, particularly those enabled by blockchain technology, provide effective solutions to monopolistic market tendencies?
- What role can privacy technologies and blockchain networks play in enabling these solutions?
- What are the implications and opportunities of decentralization for future antitrust policies and regulations? How can regulators and policymakers encourage the development of decentralized technologies, like blockchain, to obtain better outcomes in encouraging competition?
- How can blockchain networks contribute to solving real world problems and, in particular, how have they created additional design space for both regulations and adjustments to platforms or services in monopolized sectors that incorporate privacy technologies and blockchain networks?

This work will build off of the paper we co-authored for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center earlier this year: [Toward Equitable Ownership and Governance in the Digital Public Sphere](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/toward-equitable-ownership-and-governance-digital-public-sphere). It’s also inspired, in part, by discussions we’ve had with MEV builders on potential applications in the context of antitrust. In order to help policymakers, regulators, and other key stakeholders understand the potential of decentralized technologies, we’ve found it is critical to undertake in-depth research and then make the information available in more digestible formats.

We will ultimately present our findings at the next DRC summit. We typically host summits in partnership with academic institutions, and in 2023 we have so far co-hosted three (1) [Summit on Equitable Ownership and Governance at Harvard University](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCzwqYiY2FBtDZEWK4gbNs7LwZLNsXKTTveHa1Hg8kQ/edit#slide=id.g242f1c1e297_1_397), (2) [DAO Stanford](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rmTaOga0x8Yng4Ud8IJsBqq6uCq0kJEk63UB4qYuujM/edit) at Stanford University, and (3) [2023 Canadian Emerging Tech & Policy Summit](https://daoworkshop.notion.site/2023-Canadian-Emerging-Tech-Policy-Summit-402e06f5b6164db9a1cb173a4044bceb?pvs=25) at the University of Toronto. Each summit brought together policymakers, regulators, academics, and industry interested in creating better outcomes for builders of decentralized technology. 

## Plan and Deliverables

While this proposal is specific to Phase 1, the project will be conducted in three phases over six months:

- Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Literature review and case study selection. Data collection and analysis, including interviews and market research.
- Phase 2 (Months 2-4): Writing and peer review of research paper.
- Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Drafting shorter form research outputs like blog posts, tweet threads, op-ed, and other formats as relevant. Presenting on our research at our summit most proximate to the completion of the research, which will likely take place in DC in June 2024. 

Deliverables include:

- For Phase 1, the deliverable will be a memo on the activity completed during the first two month period, which will include information on the literature review, case study selection, data collection, market research, interviews conducted, and collaborators identified to assist with the project. It may also include an outline of the proposed research paper.
- For Phases 2 and 3, the deliverables will include: (1) A comprehensive research paper detailing findings and recommendations; (2) A series of blog posts and tweet threads summarizing key insights in an accessible format; and (3) Presenting our findings materials and organizing relevant discussions at the next DRC summit.
